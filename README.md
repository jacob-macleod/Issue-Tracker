# Issue-Tracker
This is an issue tracker made with Flask and Python. I can't think of a name so I've just called it  "Issue-Tracker"

## PLEASE SWITCH TO MASTER BRACH - GITHUB CHANGED THE NAME OF BRANCHES AND I CAN'T PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH! I AM DOING *ALL* MY DEVELOPMENT ON THE MASTER BRANCH!
Sorry for the confusion, I don't know why it won't let me push to the main branch!
